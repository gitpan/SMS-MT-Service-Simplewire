SMS::MT::Service::Simplewire
============================

Description
-----------

This package contains a class for creating a standalone object or an object
that acts as a plugin for a SMS::MT receptor object. See the SMS::MT
documentation for details. This class sends mobile terminated SMS's via the
interfaces of http://www.simplewire.com.
I've included a HTML version of the POD docs in the docs subdirectory.
I've included the specs I used in the specs subdirectory.

NOTE: Non of the smart messaging methods have been tested in this version as
I do not have a Simplewire account that supports that. Only sending text
SMS's has been tested. If you do have an account that supports smart messaging,
please feel free to test these methods.
